## Purpose

The purpose of this application here is to analyze the dataset of course grades from 2010 - 2015 at the University of Washington Seattle. For analysis, I chose a dataset of class information for each class taught at the University of Washington Seattle from Fall 2010 to Fall 2015. I was particularly interested in the breakdown of the letter grading within each class. This data is anonymized and can be manipulated to highlight features that are important to current University of Washington Seattle students. Using my visualizations and this data, the user can discover which classes have a higher average GPA when stratified by year.

## Data

The data here comes from a Final Project 3 students from the University of Washington Seattle worked on in a course they took called INFO 201: Technical Foundations of Informatics. The dataset is primarily divided up into 20 columns which consists of the Year, Quarter, Class, Title, Instructor, Student Count, Average GPA, and 13 columns for letter grades (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, F, and W). I decided to have the app be filtered mainly by 3 of these columns, which are the Class, Instructor, and Year. The Class would be conditionally dependent on the Year and the Instructor would be conditionally dependent on both the Class and Year.
